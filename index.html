        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be immersed in a different culture and place, and I will allow myself to grow out of my comfort zone that my family and friends provide back home in Venezuela.":</p>
        <p>I have learnt, patience, kindness beyond just being kind, how to be the brain for three people and not just one, how to love the children without any doubt as they just give and give love</p>
        <p>I personally have grown more than I can say, and am even more grateful for the experience Colombia has granted me</p>
